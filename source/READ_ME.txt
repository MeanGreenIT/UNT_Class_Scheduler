To Compile On Linux
- Build Essentials must be installed
- libmysqlclient-dev must be installed
- Make must be installed
- Cmake must be installed

To Compile On Windows
- Install MSYS2
- Install build-essentials, make and cmake in MSYS2

In Both Navigate to the source folder and run:
- make
- make clean
- make

Why you have to do it that way I'm not sure but it works
